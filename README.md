# web-form-test
Cypress testing with Web Forms.

Test cases can be found in the Excel file.

When you have Cypress opened, select the "webformtest.spec.js" file to run it and see the tests in action! (NOTE THAT CURRENTLY, I ONLY HAVE THE CYPRESS FILES UPLOADED AND NOT THE ENTIRE PROJECT. DUE TO GITHUB'S SIZE LIMIT, I'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO UPLOAD THE REST OF THE PROJECT).

The website that is being tested can be found here: https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/form
